## nat

To get an idea of what the core **nat** package and friends can do:

* Browse the natverse [gallery](/gallery/)
* Skim through the Articles listed at https://natverse.github.io/nat/
* Take a look at the [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) reports used 
  to generate the [figures for our NBLAST paper](http://flybrain.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/si/nblast/www/paper/).

When you're ready to learn more:

* Read the [overview package documentation](https://natverse.github.io/nat/reference/nat-package.html)
  (`?nat` in R)
* Read the [Introduction to neurons](https://natverse.github.io/nat/articles/neurons-intro.html) article
* Check out the thematically organised [function reference documentation](https://natverse.github.io/nat/reference/). 
  * Most help pages include examples.
* Try out sample code:
  - [nat.examples](https://github.com/jefferis/nat.examples) has detailed 
    examples for data sets from a range of model organisms and techniques
  - [frulhns](https://github.com/jefferis/frulhns) analysis of sexually dimorphic circuits
  - [NBLAST figures](https://github.com/jefferislab/NBLAST_figures/)

## Bridging and Mirroring registrations
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/006353"><img src="../images/manton_biorxiv.png"" align="right" height="300" /></a>

We introduced the concept of bridging registrations between template
brains in Manton et al 2014. This allows a huge amount of neuroanatomical
data from different labs acquired using both light and electron microscopy 
to brought into a common space for shared analysis. The natverse provides
efficient tools to move data from one template brain to another. This
paper introduces and motivates our general approach with many examples.

## NBLAST

NBLAST is a fast and sensitive algorithm for comparing neuron structure. It is
described in an open access publication, Costa et al. 2016. Read the paper
to understand how the algorithm works and to see many examples of its use.

## Learning R

Naturally you will need to learn some basics of the R language to use the
natverse. There are a huge number of books and online resources now available.
The tidyverse website has some good suggestions, see 
https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/. Resources that we recommend include:

* http://swirlstats.com (an interactive way to get started for complete beginners) 
* https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/ (a quick way to find key functions for data munging tasks)
* http://adv-r.had.co.nz (chapters 1-7 are a good investment if you plan to spend much time in R)
