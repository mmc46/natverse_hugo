The natverse is a [collection of interoperable R packages](/packages) to import, visualise, analyse, manipulate and export 3D neuroanatomical data, including neurons, brains and brain regions. It has been used to study brain and circuit organisation in species from flies to fish and mice. You can install quickly like this: 
```
install.packages('natmanager')
natmanager::install('core') # basic install
natmanager::install('natverse') # or full install
```
See the [install page](/install) for full details, especially if you are new to R.
