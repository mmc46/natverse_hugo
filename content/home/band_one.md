title: Neuroanatomical data analysis
---

The natverse is a [collection of interoperable R packages](/packages) to import, visualise, analyse, manipulate and export 3D neuroanatomical data, including neurons, brains and brain regions. These tools have been used to study brain and circuit organisation in a range of species including flies, fish and mice.

Install the natverse with:
```
if(!requireNamespace('remotes')) install.packages('remotes')
remotes::install_github("natverse/natverse")
```
