title: Neuroanatomical data analysis
---

The natverse is a [collection of interoperable R packages](/packages) to import, visualise, analyse, manipulate and export 3D neuroanatomical data, including neurons, brains and brain regions. It has been used to study brain and circuit organisation in species from flies to fish and mice. After the [prerequisites](https://github.com/natverse/NatManager#prerequisite) are configured, you can install the natverse with:
```
install.packages('natmanager')
natmanager::install('core') # basic install
natmanager::install('natverse') # or full install
```
